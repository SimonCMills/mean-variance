Main directories are: 

1. [Scripts](https://github.com/SimonCMills/mean-variance/tree/master/scripts) contains all code to clean data, run analyses, and generate figures

2. [Files](https://github.com/SimonCMills/mean-variance/tree/master/files) contains files used in analyses. This does not contain the raw UKCP09 data, which can be accessed at https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/data/ukcp09, but does have the formatted versions used in analyses. It is also not populated with UKBMS data, which can be obtained from http://www.butterfly-monitoring.net/ebms

3. [Figures](https://github.com/SimonCMills/mean-variance/tree/master/figures) has figures generated from code in scripts folder, plus a schematic that was created manually.
